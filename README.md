## Autonomous deep ocean exploration drone 

Inspired by future mission for exploration of Europa's(moon of Jupyter) ocean.

A remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) is a tethered underwater mobile device.
This meaning is different from remote control vehicles operating on land or in the air. 
ROVs are unoccupied, highly maneuverable, and operated by a crew either aboard a vessel/floating platform or on proximate land.
